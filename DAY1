📅 Day 1: Before You Start SQL – Understand the Basics
🔹 What is SQL?
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It’s a language we use to talk to databases.

For example:

“Show me all customers older than 30.”

“Tell me how much money we made this month.”

We can ask these questions to a database using SQL — and get the answers.


🔹 What is a Database?
Think of a database like a digital cupboard where data is stored neatly.

Example:

Cupboard = Database

Each shelf = Table

Things on the shelf = Data

Everything is stored in the right place, and easy to find.

🔹 File System vs Database
Imagine having 500 Excel files and trying to find the top 5 customers — total headache, right? But with everything inside a database, one small SQL query and boom – done!

🔹 Where is SQL Used in Real Life?
Behind apps and websites (login info, orders, etc.) Reporting tools like Power BI or Tableau. Used daily by Data Analysts, Developers, Testers – almost everyone in tech!

🔹 What is DBMS?
DBMS = Database Management System. It’s a software that manages databases.

It handles:
Who can access the data

Managing multiple users

Keeping the data safe and organized

Popular ones: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server

🔹 What is a Server?
A server is a powerful computer that runs 24/7.

It hosts your database so you (and your app or website) can access it anytime.

Nowadays, most servers run on the cloud – like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

🔹 Different Types of Databases

Relational	Stores data in tables, like Excel sheets	MySQL, PostgreSQL

Key-Value	Like a dictionary – one key, one value	Redis, DynamoDB

Column-Based	Stores data column-wise, fast for reading	Cassandra, Redshift

Document-Based	Stores data like full JSON documents	MongoDB

Graph	Focuses on relationships, like social media	Neo4j

Right now, we’re focusing on Relational Databases – that’s where SQL is used.

🔹 Structure of a Database (Hierarchy)

 └── Database
      └── Schema (logical group of tables)
           └── Table
                ├── Columns (fields)
                └── Rows (data)
✅ Quick Summary
SQL is a language to talk to databases.

Databases help you store and manage data smartly.

DBMS is the software that runs the database.

Servers host databases – usually on the cloud.
