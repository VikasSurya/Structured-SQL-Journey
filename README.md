# 📘 Structured SQL Journey

Welcome to my personal SQL learning journey!  
This repository is my attempt to document everything I learn — from absolute basics to advanced SQL concepts — in a structured, beginner-friendly way.

### 🌱 Why this repo?
Most SQL tutorials online are either too technical or scattered.  
I'm writing notes in **natural, easy-to-understand English**, so even someone without a coding background can follow along.

### 🧠 Who is this for?
- Beginners starting with SQL
- Students preparing for interviews
- Anyone who wants clean, simple explanations of SQL concepts

### 🗂️ What to expect?
- 📂 Daily topic-wise markdown files (`day01_intro.md`, `day02_select.md`, etc.)
- 🧾 Real-life explanations and relatable examples
- ✅ Regular updates — I'm learning and writing every day

---

> 🚀 Follow along — one concept at a time.  
> 💡 Let’s go from **confused** to **confident** — together!
